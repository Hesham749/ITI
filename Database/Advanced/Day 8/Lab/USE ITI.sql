-- trigger has no parameters  / --! sp has paramters
-- trigger calls automatically / --! sp can be called or execute
-- trigger has no return  / --! sp can has return but can only return int
-- trigger has inserted and deleted tables /  --!sp has not
-- trigger takes the tables schema and changes if it changes /  --!sp has it own schema no matter what the tables schema inside it

--*2

--func must have return / --! sp may not have proc
--func run the full exec cycle every time it called / --! sp run the full exec cycle only in the first call then it starts from the tree
-- func can be used in select statement directly and can use join with it  // --! sp can't be used in joins and select statement
-- func can't use dml / --! sp can use dml
-- func can't use dynamic queries   / --! sp can have dynamic queries


--*3

-- drop is ddl / --! delete is dml
-- drop delete the the data and the mete data // --! delete only deletes the data
-- can't use where clause with drop // --! can use where clause with delete

--*4

-- select retrive the data //  --! select into make a copy from table in a new table with meta data and data or meta data only based on the condition

--*5

-- ddl used to create , alter or drop data bases or schema or any db object
-- dml used to insert , update or  delete  in  the table (uses with  actual data)
-- dcl used to control the user permission (grant , revoke)
-- dql used to get the data

--*6
--table valued can't have if statement inside it

--*9
-- view is logical table can't by dynamic table can't have parameters // --! inline function alaways return table that can by dynamic because it can have paramters make it more flexible


--*10
-- identity it is auto increment and you can't insert values in it's column it is alawys unique // --! unique constraint can insert in it's column but it can't be duplicated
